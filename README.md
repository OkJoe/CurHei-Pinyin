# CurHei-Pinyin
## The Cursive Hei Font with Pinyin 

### Introduction 
This font is a cursive Chinese font and a Hei Chinese font. The font hopes to facilitate learning cursive Chinese writing, as well as providing a standardized glyph base of cursive Chinese characters. 

### License Info 
This font is developed from and compatible with SourceHanSansSC (思源黑体) by Adobe. The ultimate goal is to replace all characters within so that this font is free of legal liabilities. 

You are welcomed to promote the font with acknowledgement to its author(s). 

### Features 
* Pinyin on top of the characters makes the font great for captions (not yet available). 
* Chooses the correct form by context, when the simplified character comes from multiple traditional forms. 

### Short Term Goals 
* Reach 500 new characters (327/500). 
* Add Pinyin for all new characters (0/500). 
* Cover traditional Chinese glyphs (maybe also other CJK ideographs). 

### Long Term Goals
* Complete the 3755 common characters and then the total of 6763 GB2312-80 characters. 
* Recreate (or not) the 682 non-Chinese character symbols of GB2312-80. 
* Achieve stability on all platforms with OpenType Features.
