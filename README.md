# CursiveHei-Pinyin（正艹黑体-拼音）
## The Sans Serif Chinese Font with Pinyin 

### Introduction 
This font is a cursive Chinese font and a Sans Serif Chinese font. By designing this font, we hope to facilitate learning cursive Chinese writing style, as well as providing a standardized glyph database of cursive Chinese characters. 
The ttf file "CursiveHei-Regular" comes without Pinyin, and "CursiveHei-Pinyin" has Pinyin on top of the characters. 

### Acknowledgement

This font is developed from and SourceHanSansSC (思源黑体) by Adobe. 
Pinyin is added with the tools developed by the Mengshen project. http://www.mengshen-project.com

### Features 
* Pinyin on top of the characters makes the font great for captions and cursive style learners. 
* Contextual choice of forms, when the simplified character comes from multiple traditional forms. 
* This font is not designed for CJK ideographs other than Chinese. Usage in other languages may not yield desired results (Chữ Nôm, Hanja, Kanji). 

### Tasks
* Complete 3500 characters (511/3500). 
* Cover traditional Chinese glyphs. 
* Create component glyphs to facilitate making new glyphs. 

### Goals
* Complete the 3500 common characters and then all 8105 通用规范汉字表(2013) characters. 
* Complete the 3755 common characters and then all 6763 GB2312-80 characters. 
* Stable OpenType Features on all plateforms.
